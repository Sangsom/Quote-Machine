Project created by using (They Said So API)[https://theysaidso.com].

In this project I was practicing on the following skills:

- Using GDC (Grand Dispatch Centrals) for loading data asynchronously
- Using ViewController, TableViewController, NavigationController, and TabBarController
- URLSession dataTasks
- UIActivityIndicatorView
- UIAlertController
